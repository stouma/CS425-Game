In this simple Shoot 'Em Up game, take control of the butterfly as it journeys through various environments
and stumbles across different kinds of enemies trying to get to its destination. Each kind of enemy has a

to defeat the enemies and rank up their score. Enemies have a chance of dropping a heart that gives the player
an additional life.
